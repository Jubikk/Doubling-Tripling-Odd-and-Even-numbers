# Doubling-Tripling-Odd-and-Even-numbers

Hello, My name is Joebeck Andrew F. Gusi from BSCPE 1-5.

After reading the 20 integer source text file named integers.txt, 
the program will generate two different text files. The first output file, double.txt, 
will contain the square of all even integers found in integers.txt, and the second file, triple.txt, will 
contain the cube of all odd integers found in integers.txt.

Thank you for using my program!!
